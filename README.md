# ðŸ“Š Student Score Prediction â€“ Linear Regression  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project predicts a student's score based on alot of feature.  
I am use **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and a **Linear Regression model** to analyze the relationship and make predictions.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn
    
## ðŸ“ŒSteps
Import Libraries â€“ Load all necessary Python libraries.

Load Dataset â€“ Read the dataset using Pandas.

Data Cleaning â€“ Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and format data types.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“

Analyze data distribution.

Create correlation heatmaps.

Visualize relationships between features and the target variable.

Feature Selection â€“ Select the most relevant features based on correlation and domain knowledge.

Train-Test Split â€“ Split the data into training and testing sets.

Feature Scaling (Optional) â€“ Standardize or normalize features if needed.

Model Training â€“ Train a Linear Regression model using the training set.

Model Evaluation â€“

Calculate metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score.

Compare predictions with actual values.

Visualization â€“ Plot predicted vs. actual scores, regression line, and residuals.

Conclusion â€“ Summarize findings and model performance.
